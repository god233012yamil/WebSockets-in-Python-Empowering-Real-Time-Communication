# WebSockets-in-Python-Empowering-Real-Time-Communication
This repository is a simple example to demonstrate how to use websocket 
in Python. It includes two Python files, one is the code to set up a
websocket server, and the other is for a web socket client.

# Introduction
As real-time communication becomes more integral to modern applications, developers 
need tools that offer full-duplex communication between a client and a server. 
WebSockets, a communication protocol, provide a potent solution. Today, we're going 
to dive into how you can leverage WebSockets using Python.

# What are WebSockets?
WebSockets is a communication protocol providing full-duplex communication between a 
client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It excels due to its ability 
to enable servers to send data to clients without solicitation, offering two-way communication. 
This leads to reduced overhead, lower latency, and overall more efficient communication 
compared to traditional HTTP connections.

# WebSockets in Python
Python offers the websockets library as a simplistic avenue to create WebSocket servers 
and clients.

WebSockets offer an efficient protocol for real-time, two-way communication between a 
client and a server. By harnessing the power of Python's websockets library, you can 
implement WebSocket communication in your applications, enabling real-time data exchanges, 
enhancing user experiences, and delivering dynamic content updates. Start exploring today!
